# EC463-MiniProject

# Food and Recipe Barcode Scanner

Goal was creation of a cross-platform mobile application for android and ios users to scan food labels to find nutrition facts and create recipes from the items within the app.  While neither of us had experience with mobile development we have worked towards understanding the cross-platform environment React Native supports as well as the use of various API's.
